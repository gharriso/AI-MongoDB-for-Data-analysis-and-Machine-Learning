# MongoDB for Data Analysts and Machine Learning

MongoDB is today's fastest-growing database platform and the leading "NoSQL" database in the world.  While MongoDB has long been the established standard for web and mobile application development, it is also increasingly being used in broader contexts such as genomics, real-time analytics and IoT.  

Analyzing data in MongoDB presents unique challenges because of MongoDB's non-SQL interfaces and non-relational data models.  However, MongoDB includes native analytical capabilities, and there are connectors available to familiar analytic tools. 
 
In this course, you'll learn how to interact with MongoDB, use the built-in MongoDB aggregation framework, and analyze MongoDB data with familiar analytics tools such as Python, Excel, Tableau, and Spark.
